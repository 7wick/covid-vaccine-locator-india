# covid-vaccine-locator-india
Helps in filtering out all the health care centres with availability of Covid-19  vaccines in India.
It resolves few of the issues present with official website https://www.cowin.gov.in:
1. It helps you filter out only those centres which have vaccine(s) available. So it saves you from finding a needle in haystack. 
2. It also helps you filter out only those centres which have vaccine(s) available for your age. So, you do not go through a list of centres who have vaccine, but not for you.


# How to use it:

To be updated soon. Work is in final phase!

# Enhancements (TODO)

For now it works perfectly fine, for all the districts in India. 
I have to work upon:
1. Provide the list fo districts of the input state, to the user. if asked by the user.
2. Get a UI for it and host it. (Need help on this!)
